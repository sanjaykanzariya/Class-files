Programming Language:
Data Structures are the grammer of the language.
Python is easy in sytax and has relatively more inbuilt functions compared to C.
written in JAVA and C.
IDE - Integrated Development Environment

Compiler -> Interpreter -> Machine Language

Inbuilt functions in Python
1. type
2. print
3. len
4. int
5. float

Variable creation rule:
small letters recommended, CASE sensitive
cannot start with number
no special character allowed except _


31/08/2019:

Data Structure
int, float, strings
list, tuples, dictionaries, sets, boolean

Strings: PY-2 ASCII (256 characters), PY-3: Unicode (alphabets+numbers+special characters)
need to use double quotes due to an apostrophy s.
strings are indexed in python or in sequence.

slicing -> [start:stop:step size]

Strings methods
<string variable>. *press tab* lists all the methods, put parentheses (), press shift + tab

Assignment-1: (9th Sept)
1) Use at least 10 methods of strings, state their use with examples.
2) Create a string inside a string and why?
3) Note on unicode. Read about it.

mutbility = property to change the indexing with a number
immutability = cannot change the indexing for a string

Assignment-2: (10th Sept)
1) Use at least 10 list methods and state their use with examples.
2) Explain mutability and immutability with examples. Why it is important?

github account create and upload the assignment.
Repository name - Abhijit's account


ipynb = interactive python notebook
doc or txt for queries


Tuple: immutable lists

you can change the tuple to list then how does it make the code secure, where is the security?

Dictionaries:

mapping of key and value.

to create a dictionary -> {k1:v1, k2:v2}

Q: Can list be a key of a dictionary? Yes, even a tuple can be.


01/09/2019:


* Sets:-

sets are collection of unique elements.
 defined in curly braces.
s1 = {1, 2, 3}


Assignment:

1) methods of sets with examples.

Booleans:

They are used to evaluate a condition or an expression.

* Conditionals:-

if and else loop with different conditions
